# Evolution of music taste in Spain
Using the top 40 list elaborated by the Spanish music radio *Los 40 Principales* we attempt to study the evolution of musical taste in Spain in terms of genre. [Similar projects](https://thedataface.com/2016/09/culture/genre-lifecycles) can be found on the web, mine is just a national version. We expect to see a swift towards *reggaet√≥n* in the decade of 2010s.

## Scraping

We use the  [rvest](https://rvest.tidyverse.org/) R package to scrape data from the [webpage](https://los40.com/lista40/2005/1), where the playlists are.  The scraper for the gets every top 40 playlist since 2005 (first year on record). We wanted to use R as much as possible to practise, and we only coded in Python when there was no other choice.

### Known issues

* The program sometimes halts during execution flagging an error  like`in open.connection(x, "rb") : HTTP error 503`. Fortunately, since the loop is not executed inside a function all variables are global variables and one can look up the value for `k`, which is the loop variable, and start the loop from `k = 347` for example. We will try to automate the process so that no manual restart is needed.

## Classification

We use the [Discogs](www.discogs.com) database and instead of scraping the page we use the [API](https://www.discogs.com/developers/) (among other things, because we tried scraping but server complaint of too many requests). For this we use Python because there is [Python client library](https://github.com/discogs/discogs_client) (which is now deprecated, nonetheless is the one we used).  Multiple genres are assigned to the same song so later we will need a way to consider them separately. Not all songs are assigned a genre successfully, but the number of songs which are left unclassified is small and the dataset could be completed by hand.

### Known issues

* The program sometimes halts during execution flagging different errors: too many requests, disconnected from server, too many retries, etc. Fortunately, since the loop is not executed inside a function all variables are global variables and one can look up the value for `i`, which is the loop variable, and start the loop from `i = 347` for example.Wewill try to automate the process so that no manual restart is needed.

## Analysis

We create a new dataframe where rows correspond to specific top 40 lists referenced by year and week of the year, and the rest of the columns are all the possible genres songs can belong to. We compute the fraction of songs in every playlists that belong to each genre. We will use weights to give more importance to those songs at the top of the list.

## Plotting

I expected I would be using [gganimate](https://gganimate.com/) package as well as [Plotly](https://plotly.com/r/), but both of them gave me headaches. The first because graphics were distorted, and the second because as it tries to make an interactive plot and my dataset is huge it crashed. So as of now, I have exported all graphs as PDFs and later made a GIF out of them using [this online tool](https://ezgif.com/pdf-to-gif).
