# Evolution of music taste in Spain
Using the top 40 list elaborated by the Spanish music radio *Los 40 Principales* I attempt to study the evolution of musical taste in Spain in terms of genre. [Similar projects](https://thedataface.com/2016/09/culture/genre-lifecycles) can be found on the web, mine is just a national version. I expect to see a swift towards *reggaet√≥n* in the decade of 2010s.

## Scraping

The whole project is coded with R. We use the  [rvest](https://rvest.tidyverse.org/) package for scrapping., to obtain the data from the [webpage](https://los40.com/lista40/2005/1) where the playlist is.  The scraper for the gets every top 40 playlist since 2005 (first year on record).

### Known issues

* The program sometimes halts during execution flagging an error  like`in open.connection(x, "rb") : HTTP error 503`. Fortunately, since the loop is not executed inside a function all variables are global variables and one can look up the value for `k`, which is the loop variable, and start the loop from `k = 347` for example. I will try to automate the process so that no manual restart is needed.

## Classification

My initial idea is to use Wikipedia to get the genre for every song. The Wikipedia page for a song, eg. *We are never ever getting back together* by Taylor Swift, has a table with song attributes. You can see that there is a row **Genre** from which to extract the information. 

<img src="screenshot.png" alt="Wikipedia table for the song *We are never ever getting back together*" style="zoom:60%;" />

Since there is no way to tell which genre is more representative for the song  (I don't believe the order in which they appear is determinant), I will use all of them. All genres will be written in the same cell as a string eg. *'Bubblegum pop, dance-pop, pop rock, electropop'* and afterwards when reading the genres in the analysis phase, we will split the string by commas.

## Plotting

Expect to see animated plots using the [gganimate](https://gganimate.com/) package as well as [Plotly](https://plotly.com/r/).
